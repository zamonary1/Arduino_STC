# Arduino IDE core for STC based boards

**Fork of project by ma6254. Consider giving it a star too.**
**This project is in early alpha state and currently doesn't work.**

## Introduction

This repo adds the support of cheap STC microcontrollers to Arduino IDE.

Currently supports only C syntax.

## Supported boards


| Microcontroller |     Support     |
| :---------------: | :---------------: |
|    STC8G1K08    | ðŸ‘Ž(in progress) |
|   STC8G1K08A   | ðŸ‘Ž(in progress) |
